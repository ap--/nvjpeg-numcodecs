# nvjpeg_numcodecs

This is a playground for getting nvjpeg decoding into numcodecs to
benchmark if tile loading for deeplearning can be significantly sped
up when decoding directly on the GPU.

Nothing to see here yet. Come back later...

Currently, this is a bit of a playground for testing feasibility and
establishing good benchmarks. But feel free to open issues in the
issue tracker in case you would like to help and or contribute :heart:
