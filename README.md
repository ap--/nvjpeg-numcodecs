# nvjpeg_numcodecs &mdash; :warning: Nothing to see here yet. Come back later...

This is a playground for getting nvjpeg decoding into numcodecs to
benchmark if tile loading for deeplearning can be significantly sped
up when decoding directly on the GPU.

## :construction: :construction: Notes :construction: :construction:

Currently, this is a bit of a playground for testing feasibility and
establishing good benchmarks. But feel free to open issues in the
issue tracker in case you would like to help and or contribute :heart:
